## PCR and gel electrophoresis
### PCR

The steps of PCR can be divided into three main stages:

1. Denaturation: During this step, the DNA template is heated to a high temperature (usually around 95 °C) to separate the two strands of the double helix.

2. Annealing: The temperature is then lowered (50-65 °C) to allow short pieces of DNA called primers to bind to specific sequences on the template DNA. These primers serve as a starting point for the synthesis of new DNA strands.

3. Extension: The temperature is raised again (72 °C) to allow the enzyme DNA polymerase to synthesize new DNA strands using the primers as a starting point. The DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strands in the 5' to 3' direction, adding nucleotides one at a time to the growing strand. This process is repeated many times to amplify the desired DNA or RNA sequence.

During the course of PCR, the amount of DNA in the sample increases exponentially, resulting in a large number of copies of the target sequence.

## DNA fingerprinting

DNA fingerprinting using short tandem repeats (STRs, e.g. ATATATATAT, GATGATGATGATGATGATGAT, ...) involves the following steps:

1. DNA extraction: DNA is extracted from a sample of cells, such as blood, saliva, or tissue.

2. Amplification of STRs: The DNA sample is amplified using the PCR technique. During PCR, specific primers are used to target and amplify the STRs, which are repeating sequences of DNA that vary in length from person to person.

3. Detection of amplified STRs: The amplified STRs are then separated according to size using a technique called gel electrophoresis. This involves applying an electrical current to a gel matrix, which causes the DNA fragments to move through the gel. Smaller fragments move faster through the gel, while larger fragments move more slowly.

4. Analysis of STRs: The separated STRs are then visualized using electrophoresis. The resulting pattern of STRs is unique to an individual and can be used to identify them.

5. Comparison of STR patterns: The STR pattern obtained from the sample is compared to a known reference sample, such as a sample from a suspect in a criminal investigation, to determine if the two samples are from the same person.
